The attitude toward time and environment known as “multitasking” does not represent civilizational progress. Human beings in the late-modern society of work and information are not the only ones capable of multitasking. Rather, such an aptitude amounts to regression.

Ehrenberg locates depression in the same epoch when the “sovereign man” announced by Nietzsche has become mass reality.

The depressive is tired from the constant “need for initiative.”
