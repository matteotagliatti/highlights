Most people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality. How we deal with uncomfortable internal triggers determines whether we pursue healthful acts of traction or self-defeating distractions.

It’s good to know that feeling bad isn’t actually bad; it’s exactly what survival of the fittest intended.

Our tendencies toward boredom, negativity bias, rumination, and hedonic adaptation conspire to make sure we’re never satisfied for long.

•    If we want to master distraction, we must learn to deal with discomfort.

STEP 1: LOOK FOR THE DISCOMFORT THAT PRECEDES THE DISTRACTION
STEP 2: WRITE DOWN THE TRIGGER
STEP 3: EXPLORE YOUR SENSATIONS
STEP 4: BEWARE OF LIMINAL MOMENTS

A technique I’ve found particularly helpful for dealing with this distraction trap is the “ten-minute rule.” If I find myself wanting to check my phone as a pacification device when I can’t think of anything better to do, I tell myself it’s fine to give in, but not right now. I have to wait just ten minutes.

If we still want to perform the action after ten minutes of urge surfing, we’re free to do it, but that’s rarely still the case. The liminal moment has passed, and we’re able to do the thing we really wanted to do.

Bogost gives the example of mowing his lawn. **“It may seem ridiculous to call an activity like this ‘fun,’” he writes, yet he learned to love it. Here’s how: “First, pay close, foolish, even absurd attention to things.”**

Operating under constraints, Bogost says, is the key to creativity and fun.

•    We can master internal triggers by reimagining an otherwise dreary task. Fun and play can be used as tools to keep us focused.
•    Play doesn’t have to be pleasurable. It just has to hold our attention. 
•    Deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun.

He believes that willpower is not a finite resource but instead acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run out” of joy or anger, willpower ebbs and flows in response to what’s happening to us and how we feel.

when we need to perform a difficult task, it’s more productive and healthful to believe a lack of motivation is temporary than it is to tell ourselves we’re spent and need a break

individuals who believed they were powerless to fight their cravings were much more likely to drink again.

What we say to ourselves is vitally important. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control actually leads to less self-control. Rather than telling ourselves we failed because we’re somehow deficient, we should offer self-compassion by speaking to ourselves with kindness when we experience setbacks.

shortcomings” tend to be happier. Another study found that people’s tendency to self-blame, along with how much they ruminated on a problem, could almost completely mediate the most common factors associated with depression and anxiety.

remind yourself that obstacles are part of the process of growth. We don’t get better without practice, which can be difficult at times.

•    We don’t run out of willpower. Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist. 
•    What we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control is self-defeating. 
•    Practice self-compassion. Talk to yourself the way you’d talk to a friend. People who are more self-compassionate are more resilient.

Our most precious asset—our time—is unguarded, just waiting to be stolen. If we don’t plan our days, someone else will.

You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it’s distracting you from.

Keeping a timeboxed schedule is the only way to know if you’re distracted. If you’re not spending your time doing what you’d planned, you’re off track.

I wasn’t falling back asleep because I was worried about not falling back asleep—a common cause of insomnia.

•    Interruptions lead to mistakes.
•    Defend your focus. Signal when you do not want to be interrupted. Use a screen sign or some other clear cue to let people know you are indistractable.
