I"ÿ<p>The North Indian cuisine I grew up eating is about melding together distinct, disparate flavors and building up layer upon layer of spice and seasoning. Much of European cuisine, by contrast, is about combining complementary flavors â€” think potatoes with leeks, or scallops with white wine.</p>

<p>what makes Indian cuisine so exquisite is its tendency to bring together lots of different ingredients with flavor molecules that donâ€™t overlap.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s quite different from how Western cuisine works â€” previous research has shown that it relies on pairing ingredients that, at the molecular level, share lots of similar flavor compounds.</p>

<p>this notion of layering many contrasting flavors and spices isnâ€™t unique to Indian cooking.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the worldâ€™s cuisines tend to follow that principle â€¦ up until the mid-1600s, European cuisine was the same way.</p>

<p>Back in the Middle Ages, spices were really expensive, which meant that only the upper class could afford them. But things started to change as Europeans began colonizing parts of India and the Americas.</p>

<p>Serving richly spiced stews was no longer a status symbol for Europeâ€™s wealthiest families â€” even the middle classes could afford to spice up their grub. â€œSo the elite recoiled from the increasing popularity of spices,â€ Rather than infusing food with spice, they said things should taste like themselves. Meat should taste like meat, and anything you add only serves to intensify the existing flavors.â€</p>
