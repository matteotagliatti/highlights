            <h1>The Psychology of Money</h1>
            <p class="author">Morgan Housel</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>“A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.”</p>

<p>“There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.”</p>

<p>“The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless.”</p>

<p>In other words, when we signal that we’re wealthy and that people should like an admire us, what really happens is people ignore the person in possession of of the object of envy and just focus on the possession.</p>

<p>Wealth is hidden. Wealth is income that is saved, not spent. Wealth is optionality, flexibility and growth. Wealth is the ability to purchase stuff if you needed to.</p>

<p>“Learning to be happy with less money creates a gap between what you have and what you want—similar to the gap you get from growing your paycheck, but easier and more in your control.”</p>

<p>“Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.” Solution: Don’t worry about what other people think or feel the need to keep up with the Joneses.</p>

<p>“Margin of safety—you can also call it room for error or redundancy—is the only effective way to safely navigate a world that is governed by odds, not certainties.”</p>

<p>“The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goals are likely to change in the future.”</p>

<p>“Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you.”</p>

<p>Derive pleasure from free or low cost activities: exercise, reading, podcasts, learning.</p>
