<p>The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.</p>

<p>Because there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know, there are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t measure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they could be. And this rips us apart inside.</p>

<p>law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.</p>

<p>Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.</p>

<p>Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure.</p>

<p>Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given.</p>

<p>if you feel crappy it’s because your brain is telling you that there’s a problem that’s unaddressed or unresolved. In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it.</p>

<p>Emotions are part of the equation of our lives, but not the entire equation. Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments. Therefore, we shouldn’t always trust our own emotions. In fact,</p>

<p>Emotions are part of the equation of our lives, but not the entire equation. Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments. Therefore, we shouldn’t always trust our own emotions. In fact, I believe we should make a habit of questioning them.</p>

<p>You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids. And dogs.</p>

<p>An obsession and overinvestment in emotion fails us for the simple reason that emotions never last. Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more.</p>

<p>Psychologists sometimes refer to this concept as the “hedonic treadmill”: the idea that we’re always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel very different.</p>

<p>Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles.</p>

<p>the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience—not the avoidance of it, not the salvation from it.</p>

<p>That’s the hard question that matters, the question that will actually get you somewhere.</p>

<p>Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.</p>

<p>The more freedom we’re given to express ourselves, the more we want to be free of having to deal with anyone who may disagree with us or upset us. The more exposed we are to opposing viewpoints, the more we seem to get upset that those other viewpoints exist. The easier and more problem-free our lives become, the more we seem to feel entitled for them to get even better.</p>

<p>Pleasure is a false god. Research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose.</p>

<p>And yet, pleasure is what’s marketed to us, twenty-four/seven. It’s what we fixate on.</p>

<p>Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero.</p>

<p>The fact is, people who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. They lack the ability to take on new perspectives and empathize with others. They close themselves off to new and important information. It’s far more helpful to assume that you’re ignorant and don’t know a whole lot.</p>

<p>sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it.</p>

<p>Denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction. Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems—problems which, by the way, if you’re choosing the right values and metrics, should be invigorating you and motivating you.</p>

<p>The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values.</p>

<p>These activities are stressful, arduous, and often unpleasant. They also require withstanding problem after problem. Yet they are some of the most meaningful moments and joyous things we’ll ever do. They involve pain, struggle, even anger and despair—yet once they’re accomplished, we look back and get all misty-eyed telling our grandkids about them.</p>

<p>As Freud once said, “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.”</p>

<p>This is why these values—pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive—are poor ideals for a person’s life. Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive. The point is to nail down some good values and metrics, and pleasure and success will naturally emerge as a result. These things are side effects of good values. By themselves, they are empty highs.</p>

<p>Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable.</p>

<p>Bad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate or controllable.</p>

<p>Honesty is a good value because it’s something you have complete control over, it reflects reality, and it benefits others</p>

<p>people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)</p>

<p>Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that good, healthy values are achieved internally. Something like creativity or humility can be experienced right now.</p>

<p>Bad values, while sometimes fun or pleasurable, lie outside of your control and often require socially destructive or superstitious means to achieve.</p>

<p>generate happiness, pleasure, and success as side effects. This, in a nutshell, is what “self-improvement” is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about.</p>

<p>We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond.</p>

<p>Whether we like it or not, we are always taking an active role in what’s occurring to and within us. We are always interpreting the meaning of every moment and every occurrence. We are always choosing the values by which we live and the metrics by which we measure everything that happens to us. Often the same event can be good or bad, depending on the metric we choose to use. The point is, we are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always.</p>

<p>The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives.</p>

<p>Accepting responsibility for our problems is thus the first step to solving them.</p>

<p>I began to understand that although she had done something horrible to me and she could be blamed for that, it was now my own responsibility to make myself happy again.</p>

<p>I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it’s likely you are too, you just don’t realize it.</p>

<p>taking responsibility for our problems is far more important, because that’s where the real learning comes from.</p>

<p>Growth is an endlessly iterative process. When we learn something new, we don’t go from “wrong” to “right.” Rather, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong.</p>

<p>we don’t actually know what a positive or negative experience is. Some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating. Some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating.</p>

<p>measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator.</p>

<p>define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible.</p>

<p>pain is part of the process.</p>

<p>just shut up and do it.</p>

<p>“If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it.</p>
