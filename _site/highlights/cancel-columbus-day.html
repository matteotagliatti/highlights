            <p>New research pinpoints an exact date Vikings from Europe were in North America: 1021 A.D. (one millennium ago this year), 430 years before Christopher Columbus was even born. How was this determination possible? Because the Sun erupted in an immense series of storms that altered Earth’s atmosphere, leaving measurable changes in tree rings at the time.</p>

<p>This is where the Sun comes in. In the years 774 and 993 the Sun blasted out some truly epic explosions called solar storms, most likely in the form of solar flares.</p>

<p>These flares send out huge waves of subatomic particles into space. When they slam into Earth’s atmosphere they can generate aurorae and power outages, but they also create isotopes of certain atoms</p>

<p>A team of scientists looked at wood found at the L’Anse aux Meadows Viking site. In three cases the trees had been physically cut down, and moreover, they were clearly cut with metal tools — Vikings had metal implements at the time, but indigenous people did not.</p>

<p>The scientists extracted 127 samples from the wood, and 83 rings were examined. They used two methods to secure dates. The first was to compare the amount of carbon-14 in each ring with known atmospheric amounts from the time. This gives a rough date for the waney edge of the wood. They also then looked for an anomalous spike in carbon-14 in an inner ring, knowing this would have come from the 993 A.D. event, and then simply counted the rings outward from there to get the date of the waney edge. In all three samples the waney edge was dated to the same year: 1021 A.D. This would be incredibly unlikely to occur at random.</p>

<p>This means that Vikings were definitely in North America, specifically Newfoundland, Canada, more than four and a half centuries before Columbus</p>

<p>looking at different kinds of cells in the wood the scientists could tell one tree was felled in the spring of that year, while another was in the summer/​autumn, indicating the Vikings were there for several months.</p>
