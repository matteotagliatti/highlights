            <p>The literature of the minimalist lifestyle is an exercise in banality.</p>

<p>He argued that the major characteristic of this group was that their work had “minimal art content,” that is, a lack of the usual qualities that traditionally define Western art.</p>

<p>Instead, the Minimalist artists adopted manufactured materials and incorporated found objects. They planned their pieces on paper, more like architects or designers, and then had the work fabricated entirely outside of their studios,</p>

<p>there actually was a form of labor to Minimalism. It was just more curatorial than physical. The choices of material, treatment, and scale were artistic acts,</p>

<p>What we describe as minimalist today—the white t-shirts, monochrome apartments, and wireframe furniture—doesn’t have much in common with the artists that Judd, Wollheim, and others gathered together in their criticism.</p>

<p>The artists were revolutionary not because of a shared homogenized style but because of a particular leap that they made: The art object did not have to represent anything, document reality, or even communicate the artist’s individuality.</p>

<p>The artists were revolutionary not because of a shared homogenized style but because of a particular leap that they made: The art object did not have to represent anything, document reality, or even communicate the artist’s individuality. It was enough to generate a presence, to become part of the world, and the viewer should appreciate the work as such.</p>
